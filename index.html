            <h3 id="landingPageTextBox">
                FLUTD is the abbreviation of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, which is a general term for a variety
                of
                conditions affecting the bladder and urethra. It includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Urinary calculi</li>
                    <li>Bladder stones</li>
                    <li>Urinary tract infection (UTI)</li>
                    <li>Urinary obstruction</li>
                    <li>Feline idiopathis cystitis (FIC)</li>
                </ul>
                It is a critical or even fatal disease if not
                treated timely.
                If you are a new cat owner, you might hardly imagine you would need to know about this and take
                preventive action
                to fight against FLUTD.
                It is actually a very common disease for a cat, taking up around 10% of the vet visits. Male cats are
                more vulnerable to this disease
                due to the nature that their urethra are generally narrower than the female ones.

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Kidney</strong> generates urine and releases to <strong>Bladder</strong> through
                    <strong>Ureter</strong>. Urine will be accumulated
                    in Bladder to the point that the cat feels like urinating. And then urine will go through
                    <strong>Urethra</strong> to <strong>Penis</strong> and comes out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your feline friend shows symptoms of FLUTD, please visit your primary vet for
                    physical examination. FLUTD contains a broad group of diseases requiring different treatment
                    methods, the following tests are mandatory to help determine the cause of FLUTD:
                <ul>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Urinalysis</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check if there is bacteria in the urine. If there is, bacteria infection will be the cause.
                        </li>
                        <li>Check if there is crystal in the urine. If there is, crystal will be the cause.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Blood Test</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>RBC (Red Blood Cell) - High level indicates disease or disorder</li>
                        <li>WBC (White Blood Cell) - High level indicates infection. </li>
                        <li>Creatinine - High level indicates kidney problems</li>
                        <li>BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) - High level indicates kidney failure or diseases</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Radiograph</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check if there is stone in the bladder. If there is, stone will the cause.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li class='li_1st'>FIC - Feline Idiopathis Cystitis</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the vet couldn't find bacteria, crystal or stone through the above tests, it will be
                            diagnosed as FIC.
                            FIC can be mild but also can be critical. When your feline friend cannot urinate, it is
                            having
                            urethra obstruction, which will cause acute kidney failure consecutively.

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Relief of blockage</li>
                    <p>If the urinary passage is blocked, relief is absolutely essential. This usually requires
                        anesthesia (unless the cat is already is in a coma).
                        Although anaesthesia is dangerous because of the cat's poor condition, there is no alternative.
                        Most of these blockages yield to flushing by
                        catherisation (passing a fine tube) up the urethra. In case where the 'stones' are unusually
                        stubborn abdominal puncture of the bladder may be necessary.
                        The catheter may be left in place for a few days and a restraint collar put on the cat to
                        prevent him removing the catheter.
                        The chances of success are directly proportional to how quickly the cat has been brought in for
                        treatment.</p>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Fluid therapy</li>
                    <p>This is indicated when the cat is dehydrated or toxic. This consists of intravenous
                        administration of large volumes of balanced fluids.</p>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Antibiotics</li>
                    <p>Used to take care of infections that may develop as a result of abnormalities in the urinary
                        tract</p>

                <h2>Care</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Food & Water</li>
                    <p>Prescription wet food is strongly recommended. Hill's, Purina, Royal Canin and Blue Buffalo all
                        carry urinary diet food.
                        Wet food typically contains at least 70% of water, providing your feline friend surviving water
                        input if it doesn't like
                        to drink water.
                    </p>
                    <p>Water fountain may be helpful in attracting your cat to drink more water. Broth is also an option
                        to encourage drinking but
                        needs to be kept fresh.
                    </p>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Litter Box</li>
                    <p>Litter box needs to be cleaned as frequent as you can, ideally once a day. It is advised to
                        monitor the shape of urine clump:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Big circle - 3~4 per day indicates a healthy cat</li>
                        <li>Crescent - Cat doesn't like litter in general or this brand of litter specifically</li>
                        <li>Thin cookie - The litter should at least more than 3 inch</li>
                        <li>Small drop - Indication of potential FLUTD</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It is also suggested to maintain n+1 litter box if within financial affordability.
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <li class='li_1st'>Stress Control</li>
                    <p>Feliway is a product that comforts and reassures cats and kittens and reduces signs of stress
                        such as urine spraying,
                        scratching, fighting or hiding. It can be purchased in a spray bottle or as a plug-in diffuser.
                        Feliway for cats works
                        by emulating the natural pheromones released by a mother cat to calm her kittens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Petting and time of accompany also matter. Rotating different sets of toys for your cat if
                        possible.
